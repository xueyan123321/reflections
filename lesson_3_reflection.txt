when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping your all work local?
when I want to collebrate with others or share somethings with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
sometimes, you only want to do somethings by yourself and don't want others to see it. You wouldn't like to share with others.

describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks are about cloning the repository in github, while clones mainly are involved in cloning repository from the github server.

what is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If you have a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally, it will be very convenient for you to know the changes in the remote after you pulling the remote.
